INTRODUCTION
============

This is a set of templates for monitoring MySQL servers and other resources with
Cacti.  It is also a compact, maintainable set of template definitions and a set
of tools for generating templates from these definitions.  The project is hosted
at http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/.

Commercial support and enhancements are available through Percona, where the
developer works.  Their website is http://www.percona.com

Thanks are due to The Rimm-Kaufman Group, who sponsored part of the template
development.  The Rimm-Kaufman Group is a search engine advertising agency that
helps its clients place ads on Google, Yahoo, and other major search engines.

INSTALLATION
============

Installation instructions are online at

If the templates do not match your polling interval, desired graph size, or any
number of other qualities, you can easily generate your own.  Instructions are
in the documentation linked above.

If you find any bugs or problems not listed in the FAQ, please enter an issue

are readily available in the Cacti manual or forums.
