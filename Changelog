	* There was no easy way to force inputs to be filled (issue 45).
	* Some graphs were partially hidden without --lower-limit (issue 43).
	* Flipped some elements across the Y axis (issue 42).
	* Include settings from an external config file (issue 39).
	* Added Apache, Nginx, and GNU/Linux templates.
	* Unknown output is now -1 instead of 0 to prevent spikes in graphs.
	* If you want to use a script server, you must now explicitly configure it.
	* UNIX sockets weren't permitted for MySQL (issue 38).

	* Graphs fetched too much data, causing errors (incompatible; issue 28, 23).

	* The text on the graph could overflow the right-hand edge.
