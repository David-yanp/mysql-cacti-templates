* Set values to -1 when unknown.  Can this be used to prevent spikes in the
  graphs?  I'm not sure what the best way to do this is.
* Figure out how to get the script server to work.  I think it should work OK
  but I don't know much about it.
* There are a few things marked TODO in the PHP script.
* Make prettier template colors.  Some of them are hard to look at.
* Figure out what's wrong with the InnoDB Unflushed Log value on the InnoDB Log
  graph.  On my machine it spikes way larger than the log itself, which is
  impossible.
