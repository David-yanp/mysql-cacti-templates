INTRODUCTION

This is a set of templates for monitoring MySQL servers with Cacti.  It is also
a compact, maintainable set of template definitions and a set of tools for
generating templates from these definitions.

Thanks are due to The Rimm-Kaufman Group, who sponsored part of the template
development.  The Rimm-Kaufman Group is a search engine advertising agency that
helps its clients place ads on Google, Yahoo, and other major search engines.
Their website is http://www.rimmkaufman.com.

Thanks also to the scripts and templates that inspired this work.  Though
everything is completely rewritten, these templates bear quite a resemblance to
the earlier templates, which you can find at http://faemalia.net/mysqlUtils/

DESCRIPTION

Cacti is a nice tool, but the MySQL templates I found weren't what I was looking
for.  Also, Cacti's design can cause inefficiency if you don't know how to use
it correctly, and the existing templates didn't avoid those inefficiencies.  The
templates I've designed should work around all of these problems:

*  No duplicated data in RRD files.
*  No unused data in RRD files.
*  No wasted polling for the same data over and over.

The techniques I've used to work around this are caching with one data template
per graph template.  You can read more at
http://forums.cacti.net/viewtopic.php?t=26448.

I've also added quite a bit of data to the templates, fixed a lot of problems
with bigint math and other items, made the templates easier to use (no need to
fill in username and password for every graph you create), and so on.
