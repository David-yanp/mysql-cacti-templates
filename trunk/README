INTRODUCTION
============

This is a set of templates for monitoring MySQL servers with Cacti.  It is also
a compact, maintainable set of template definitions and a set of tools for
generating templates from these definitions.

Thanks are due to The Rimm-Kaufman Group, who sponsored part of the template
development.  The Rimm-Kaufman Group is a search engine advertising agency that
helps its clients place ads on Google, Yahoo, and other major search engines.
Their website is http://www.rimmkaufman.com.

Thanks also to the scripts and templates that inspired this work.  Though
everything is completely rewritten, these templates bear quite a resemblance to
the earlier templates, which you can find at http://faemalia.net/mysqlUtils/

INSTALLATION
============

The default templates assume you are using the default Cacti polling interval of
5 minutes (300 seconds).  If you use another polling interval, you'll need to
generate a template file accordingly.  See "GENERATING YOUR OWN TEMPLATES" later
in this file for that.

To install,

   1. Create a MySQL user on each server you want to monitor.  This user should
      have the same username and password on each server for easiest
      installation.  The user needs only the SUPER privilege.
   2. Put ss_get_mysql_stats.php into your cacti/scripts/ directory.
   3. Set the MySQL username and password in the header of that file.  Use the
      values you chose in step 1.
   4. Import the template and then create graphs as usual (beyond the scope of
      this document; see the Cacti website and manual for help).  If you didn't
      use the same username and password for each server you're monitoring, you
      will need to generate your own templates.  (Instructions are later in this
      file).

If you find any bugs or problems, please contact the author.

DESCRIPTION
===========

Cacti is a nice tool, but the MySQL templates I found weren't what I was looking
for.  Also, Cacti's design can cause inefficiency if you don't know how to use
it correctly, and the existing templates didn't avoid those inefficiencies.  The
templates I've designed should work around all of these problems:

*  No duplicated data in RRD files.
*  No unused data in RRD files.
*  No wasted polling for the same data over and over.

The techniques I've used to work around this are caching with one data template
per graph template.  You can read more at
http://forums.cacti.net/viewtopic.php?t=26448.

I've also added quite a bit of data to the templates, fixed a lot of problems
with bigint math and other items, made the templates easier to use (no need to
fill in username and password for every graph you create), and so on.

GENERATING YOUR OWN TEMPLATES
=============================

Rather than editing the templates inside Cacti and then exporting them, I've
made a compact definition file and a Perl script to generate templates.  This
makes the templates easier to maintain.  It also lets you generate custom
templates easily if the defaults shipped in the tarball aren't to your liking.

The basic idea is to run the make-template.pl script with the template
definition file as input:

   perl make-template.pl mysql_definitions.pl > my_new_template.xml

You can now import this file as usual.  Examine the --help output of the script
to see what your options are.

The generated templates don't conflict with your existing Cacti installation.
They don't use anything pre-defined in Cacti.  That means you can import them
without fear of overwriting your customized settings.  It also means they may
create things that look duplicated to you, such as their own RRA settings.  At
least you know they're separate from your existing installation, though.
