#summary Examples and documentation for the Apache templates

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Overview =

These templates use ss_get_by_ssh.php to connect to a server via SSH and extract statistics from the memcached server running there, by executing the "nc" (netcat) program with the command "STAT".  This means you don't need any memcached APIs installed.  Standard Unix command-line tools are all you need.

= Installation =

Once the [SSHBasedTemplates SSH setup] is working, test one of your hosts like this.  You may need to change some of the example values below, such as the cacti username and the hostname you're connecting to.

{{{
# su - cacti -c 'env -i php /var/www/cacti/scripts/ss_get_by_ssh.php --type memcached --host 127.0.0.1 --items b6,b7'
}}}
