#summary Cacti templates for Unix system statistics

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Overview =

These templates use ss_get_by_ssh.php to connect to a server via SSH and extract standard metrics (memory usage, number of users, CPU usage, etc) from it.  This is a good substitute for the standard kinds of system metrics one might graph via SNMP, when SNMP is not available or not desired.  For example, I've used this technique when SELinux was preventing SNMP and the company's security policy forbade modifications; or when they didn't want to pay for the time it'd take; or when monitoring servers exposed all over the Internet, and only SSH access was desired.

Right now the scripts are written and tested for GNU/Linux, but it is possible that they will work on other Unix-like operating systems.  It should certainly be easy to modify them if not, so if you find any problems, please submit bug reports or discuss on the mailing list.

= Installation =

No special installation is necessary.  Once the [SSHBasedTemplates SSH setup] is working, everything should just work.

= Context Switches =

This graph shows the number of context switches performed by the server.

= CPU Usage =

This graph shows CPU usage as derived from the /proc filesystem.  The example shows a server with two CPUs.  The values will increase by 100 with each added CPU.

= Forks =

This graph shows the number of new processes created by the system.

= Interrupts =

This graph shows how many interrupts the system handles.

= Load Average =

This graph shows system load average.  If you're used to looking at a "pretty" load average graph, you might think this one has less information.  Not so!  The standard graph that comes with Cacti is very silly: it shows the same information averaged over three time intervals, which is useless and redundant.  RRDtool can average the number for you just fine.

= Memory =

This graph shows the system's memory usage, as reported by the "free" command.

= Number of Users =

This graph shows how many users were logged into the system, as reported by the "w" command.
