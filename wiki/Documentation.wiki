= Introduction =

There's not much documentation at the moment, but please read the README file for instructions on installation, etc.  This page has so little content that I'm going to just put everything on one page to start with.

= Frequently Asked Questions =

Q. The output is truncated when I use Spine.  Why?

A. This is a Cacti bug (see Issue 2).  Use cmd.php for now.

Q. Running poller.php or ss_get_mysql_stats.php shows the correct output, but I see nothing in the graphs for MySQL in Cacti.  Why?

A. If you ran either of those commands before Cacti had a chance to, the cache_file ss_get_mysql_stats.php uses may have the wrong ownership, check the Cacti owner has access to $cache_dir/$host-mysql_cacti_stats.txt (/tmp/$host-mysql_cacti_stats.txt).  Also check the ownership on the PHP script itself; does the Cacti user have permission to execute it?  Quite a few issues have turned out to be due to people installing/running as root from the command line, not realizing that Cacti runs as a different user.

Q. I get a blank page when I try to import the templates.  Why?

A. Check your webserver log.  PHP might have run out of memory.  If you see something like "Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 10 bytes)" then you should increase memory_limit in your php.ini file and restart the webserver.
