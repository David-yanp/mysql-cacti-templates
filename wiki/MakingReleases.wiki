Here's how to create a release:

  # Make sure the Changelog is up to date and check the issue list.
  # Make a note of any changes that will require special upgrade instructions.
  # Add a "version" line to the top of the Changelog.
  # run `./make.sh` in the top level.
  # Upload the file.  Set it to Featured, and set the description to `Version XXX`.  Unset Featured on the old file.
  # Update [Changelog].
  # Update the installation instructions if necessary.
