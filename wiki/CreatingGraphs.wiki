#summary How to create a new graph

= Introduction =

The stuff you need is in meta/mysql_definitions.pl.

This file is read in as a big variable by make_template.pl.  It consists of the following sections, which will be combined to form a template for Cacti:

  * name and hash -- properties for the template.
  * gprints -- Custom sprintf formats.  You don't need to modify these.
  * graphs -- a graph is a data template plus a collection of graph items.
  * inputs -- this basically defines how the command-line script is called.
  * rras -- these are just some custome RRA definitions so you can keep more than the usual amount of data.
  * short_names -- these *must* match the values in the ss_get_mysql_stats.php file.

The hardest part is keeping track of how all these things are related to each other.  I have simplified the relationships significantly: one data template per each graph template, etc.

A graph will really be input to Cacti as a graph template and a data template.

The graph item in the meta/mysql_definitions.pl file has the following properties:

  * base_value -- either 1024 or 1000 depending on whether the unit is an amount of data or not.  (Rule: don't mix things with different units on a single graph.  If you do, you get meaningless crap most of the time.)
  * name -- the name of the graph.  Keep it short.
  * hash -- the Cacti hash.  See CactiHashes.
  * dt -- the data template.
    * hash.
    * Name of the data input.  This is the name of an item in the inputs section at the top level.
    * items to get from the data input.  These are a hash reference.  The key is the name of the value to get from the data input (e.g. pool_size for the InnoDB Buffer Pool graph template).  The hash reference's children are the:
      * type: 1 GAUGE, 2 => COUNTER, 3 => DERIVE.
      * hash.
  * items -- the array of graph items (lines and such).  Each item is a hash.  There are these properties:
    * color -- a hex color code.
    * item -- the name of the data item to graph.
    * type -- the RRD type, such as LINE1 or AREA or STACK.  Text items will automatically be added for each thing that is drawn on the graph.
    * task -- a hash.
    * hashes -- an array of hashes.  These are used for the items.  Depending on how many hashes are in the array, the graph will get varying bits of text below the picture.  The texts are Cur: Avg: Max: and you'll get them in that order, as many as you specify.  So if you only specify one hash, you'll just get Cur: on the graph.
