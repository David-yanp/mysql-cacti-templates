#summary Cacti templates for graphing Apache

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Overview =

These templates use ss_get_by_ssh.php to connect to a server via SSH and extract statistics from the Apache server running there, by executing the "wget" program with the url "/server-status".  This means you don't need to install any special tools.  Standard Unix command-line tools are all you need.

This document should be correct and complete as of version 1.1.6 of the graphs.  Please use the issue tracker or the mailing list to report any errors or omissions.

= Installation =

Once the [SSHBasedTemplates SSH setup] is working, [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_status.html configure Apache to report its status].  The typical setup is to enable status for 127.0.0.1 at the URL /server-status. If you decide to use a different URL, you'll have to configure that in the script configuration (covered in the general install guide) or pass a command-line option (also covered in the general install guide).

Be sure to configure Apache with the `ExtendedStatus On` directive so you get full status.

Finally, test one of your hosts like this.  You may need to change some of the example values below, such as the cacti username and the hostname you're connecting to.

{{{
# su - cacti -c 'env -i php /var/www/cacti/scripts/ss_get_by_ssh.php --type apache --host 127.0.0.1 --items a0,a1'
}}}
