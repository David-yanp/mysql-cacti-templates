#summary Advantages and features of these templates

Cacti is a nice tool, but the MySQL templates I found weren't what I was looking
for.  Also, Cacti's design can cause inefficiency if you don't know how to use
it correctly, and the existing templates didn't avoid those inefficiencies.  The
templates I've designed should work around all of these problems:

  *  No duplicated data in RRD files.
  *  No unused data in RRD files.
  *  No wasted polling for the same data over and over.

The techniques I've used to work around this are caching with one data template
per graph template.  You can read more at

I've also added quite a bit of data to the templates, fixed a lot of problems
with bigint math and other items, made the templates easier to use (no need to
fill in username and password for every graph you create), and so on.

The generated templates don't conflict with your existing Cacti installation.
They don't use anything pre-defined in Cacti.  That means you can import them
without fear of overwriting your customized settings.  It also means they may
create things that look duplicated to you, such as their own RRA settings.  At
least you know they're separate from your existing installation, though.
